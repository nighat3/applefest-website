# TODO

Copy **the contents** of your Project 1 or Project 2 web site **into** this directory (**www/**).

  - Do not copy anything else.
  - Do not copy the **documents** folder.
  - Do not copy the **.git** folder.
  - **Just copy the contents of the site.** (.html files, images folder, styles folder, etc.)

  This means your repository should have the following **valid** path: **www/index.html**. If you don't have this path, you didn't follow instructions.

**Warning:** Do **not** copy your **entire** Project 1 or Project 2 **folder/repo** into the **www/** folder. If you have _www/NETID-project-1/index.html_ or _www/NETID-project-2/index.html_ you did not follow the above directions and will likely have difficulty committing and pushing your Project 3 to GitHub. Not following instructions will not be considered a valid excuse for accepting late p3m1 or p3fin submissions because "Git wasn't working" or "I couldn't commit" or "I couldn't push."

(Optional) You may delete this file (TODO.md) once your have **correctly** followed these instructions.
